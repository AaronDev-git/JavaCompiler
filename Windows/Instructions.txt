Create a exe instalator from a jar

1. Generate the custom jre with the Script 
2. Place the folder jre in another folder named jre wich needs to be in the same folder as the jar
(Let's say I have my jar in a folder named example, my jre will be in: example\jre\jre/*)
3. Generate the exe using launch4j or equivalent and in the jre paths write "jre" (see the picture)
4. Once you have you'r exe open innosetup and paste the file .iss, run the compile process and you'll have a fully functionnal
installer that allows you to transform you'r jar into a exe app for Windows
